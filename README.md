# Problem Statement
The persistent misalignment between question complexity and perceived difficulty presents a fundamental challenge in AI-driven educational technologies, where subjective human judgments frequently diverge from objective question characteristics. 
<br>
<p><i>“How can we improve the AI system’s ability to generate questions with complexity levels that consistently align with human expectations of difficulty?”</i></p>

# Challenges
Achieving proper alignment between AI understanding of question complexity and human perception of difficulty faces several interrelated challenges, because "difficulty" is:
- A Fluid Concept
- Malleable
- Hard to Define and Measure

Hence, to date, a universal standard for defining and measuring question difficulty does not exist.

# Proposed Solution - The Cerebro Index Framework
Introducing the Cerebro Index (CI), a framework that integrates educational theory, cognitive science, and technical metrics into a unified system to quantify the complexity of a question.
